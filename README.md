I want to create a notebook for future check. Which will include;
- Interests
- References & Sources
- Current Work & Education
- Curiosity Areas
- Challanges
- Achievements

etc. List is not exhaustive. Could add more.

Documenting created civilization. I don't make the rules.

Also let's celebrate having GitHub Desktop. A True Game Changer.
It's just seamless. One click push-pull-clone.
Also wonderful for Obsidian.md integration. Truly remarkable. 
Thanks for suggesting Obsidian, dear friend. Now GitHub is here.
